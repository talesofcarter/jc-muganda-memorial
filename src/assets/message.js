      "We will miss you deeply, Kadhuole. You lived a full life, boldly, joyfully, and unapologetically. You always stood firm for what you believed in, with honesty and unmatched forthrightness. We did what was humanly possible to save your life but perhaps, as it turns out, heaven was more ready for you than we were. Jean was more than just an exceptional entrepreneur; she was a rare soul who valued relationships above deals, and people above profit. Though strong enough to take what she wanted by force, her heart was too big for that. In most negotiations, Jean gave more than she received, she conceded, she listened, and she loved. But if there was ever a time she fought like a lion, it was never for possessions, it was always in defense of the people she loved. Fiercely, tenderly, and without hesitation. Of all the many things she accomplished, Maya was her greatest achievement. The bond they shared was the strongest mother-daughter connection I have ever witnessed. Jean raised Maya beautifully, and in turn, Maya became her mother’s quiet guardian. Perhaps Maya was the only one among us who truly saw Jean’s hidden softness, the gentleness behind the strength. And Maya, that love you shared with your mother, it will carry you for a lifetime. But from now on, little one, we will let you be a child. We will surround you with love and protection, and we will do everything within our power to give you the life your mama so carefully envisioned for you. They say everything can be fixed, everything but life. I call myself Mr. Fix It because I always try. That Sunday morning, it was Maya’s pink dress. Jean, as always strong and swift, accidentally ripped the zipper as she dressed her up for church. Maya had seen my daughter Taraji in a pink dress and wanted one too. I fixed it, and with her signature smile, Jean helped Maya wear it proudly. But this—this we could not fix. Jean slipped through our fingers, gently and quietly, without a struggle. She chose to leave us on a peaceful Sunday, in broad daylight, as if to remind us that even the sun must set. One friend, who met Jean only once, wrote to me: ‘Jean was such a bright, joyful soul—so full of life and energy—and now she’s gone. I pray she’s at peace, embraced by something greater than all of us.’ Indeed, Jean is at peace. She rests now, as she so rightfully deserves. And to Maya—know this: you are surrounded by love. We are here for you. Always.",

      "Thanks for showing me the way you've taken on the role of big sister so beautifully. You are the incredible gift who gave me cherished title of Mother. You are the pillar upon which this family leans. Your strength, wisdom and resilience make you equal to ten men as you have always navigated the complexities of life while carrying the weight of ancestral burdens and expectations. To-date you are an equivalent of Paramount Chief Olila Muganda whom you were named after because you were born the same year that Chief Muganda left the earth of Ukwala Kingdom to sing with the Angels. Blessed is my Firstborn - your unique role; your ability to balance feminine strength  with arranged leadership skills keeps you on top. You have always balanced Family Legacy with modern challenges. l remember when your dad passed on in August 2001, my feet could not carry me to the morgue to go and pay my last respect. You held my hands, wiped my tears and together we managed. Your braveness has made me not to fear death. Rest Easy my daughter as you keep on watching over us especially my little girl Maya-Kinda.",

      "Dear Jean Carol Muganda, Jean, where do I even begin? You weren’t just my sister. You were my home, my anchor, and my daily dose of strength. A happy soul who saw possibility in everything. You were a go-getter in every sense of the word: bold, daring, and unshakably resilient. Taking risks didn’t scare you. If anything, you made it look easy. You taught me how to be street-smart—not just to survive, but to thrive with grace and confidence. You reminded me that strength isn’t about power but about heart. You lived life fully, with love, purpose, and courage. You gave generously of your heart and talents. You loved cooking, and through every dish, you shared pieces of yourself: your warmth, your laughter, your love. Your house was always open—your heart even more. You welcomed everyone. You embraced the spirit of family and made space for others in a way that only you could. Truly, Jean, you were a community. Even with miles between us, you never let distance dim our bond. You checked on me every single day, made me feel seen and valued. It was your way of saying, ‘I’m always here,’ and you were. Always. You reminded me that love travels all distances, and you lived that truth. You lived love. You were love. You embraced family, not just in words but in action—bringing people together, showing up, giving without hesitation. You’ve left behind your precious daughter, Maya. In your stories, you always said, ‘This is your kid—live knowing.’ You prepared her with love, teaching her our family, our home, and even our pets. You gave her roots. We promise you; we will give her wings. We will care for her with all the love and strength you gave us. Jean, your light will never go out. You gave us memories, lessons, and love that will last forever. Your spirit will always be with us. Rest in peace, my sister, my heart, my forever inspiration.",

Though you're no longer by my side, you live in every tender memory, every shared secret, every moment of joy that I now carry for both of us. You were more than a sister - you were my confidant, my light, my forever friend. I miss you deeply, but I hold you close in my heart where love never fades, and time cannot reach.

      "It’s hard to find the right words to honor you, our beautiful cousin, our sister, our friend. As I sit with the memories, I am reminded of  how precious every moment truly is. The last hug we shared, the words exchanged at the hospital — they now feel like sacred gifts, moments I will treasure forever. In your own gentle way, you were saying goodbye, but our hearts were not ready to understand. If I could go back, I would hold you a little longer, listen a little deeper, and love you even harder. I carry a lesson from you for life — to never take any conversation, any moment, any embrace for granted. In our plans, we thought there would be tomorrow. But heaven had its own plans. I wish I had served you a meal from the party when we shared our last hug, I wish I had sat with you just a little longer , laughed with you one more time… but even in the pain, I am grateful for the love that was shared and the memories you have left behind. You lived with so much life even in moments where you had a reason not to , so much love, and so much light — and that is what I will hold on to. Rest in perfect peace, our JC Muganda. You will forever be in my heart. Your laughter, your kindness, your beautiful spirit — they live on in us. I love you. I miss you. And I thank God for every moment we shared. For all you were, and all you still are to us. Cheers Sissy ❤️",

Her love was felt in the smallest gestures, and her presence brought comfort and peace. Jean’s meals were more than just food; they were gifts from the heart.

Her cooking had a way of bringing people together, and her kitchen was filled not just with good food, but with laughter, warmth, and unforgettable memories. Her hands nourished us, and her spirit fed our souls. As we say goodbye, our hearts turn especially toward her beloved daughter Maya. Jean’s love lives on in her, in her smile, her kindness, and the strength she will carry forward. Maya, your mother was a remarkable woman, and her legacy is yours to hold and honor. Though she is no longer with us in body, her love surrounds you always. We will walk beside you and keep her memory alive in all the beautiful ways she shaped our lives. We love you, Jean.",

      "Today, I write with a heavy heart. Jean was more than just family. She was a source of light, joy, and togetherness. Her spirit was the glue that held our Pombo family close, reminding us all of the value of connection, love, and laughter. With Jean, every gathering became a celebration of life. The last hour I spent with Jean is etched into my soul. We shared stories, like we always did, laughing, remembering, and connecting. I made her a cup of tea, not knowing it would be our last. That final tea, that final conversation, so simple, yet now so sacred. I watched her slip away, and nothing in the world could have prepared me for that pain. Still, even in those final moments, Jean gave me one last gift, the privilege to be with her, to comfort her, and to carry the weight of her passing with love. Every single day she could wake up, the first thing she could do was to take a selfie and admire herself, a reminder to make memories, to capture life’s moments, even if the pictures were blurred. ‘They still count,’ she’d say. Because of her, I learned that imperfect moments often hold the deepest beauty, and I’ll keep collecting them in her honour. Her laughter still echoes; her warmth still lingers. Though she is no longer here in body, her love remains unshakable and unforgettable. Thank you, big Jean, for the memories, for the love, for every single moment. You will always be with me in every photo I take, every cup of tea and every story I tell. I will miss you dearly💔 Take your rest Mama Maya♥️🫂",
